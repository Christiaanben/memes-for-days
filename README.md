# memesForDays

Make a small single page Vuejs application (similar to the sample), with the following features: 

- View a pre-populated list of your favourite memes, with titles, description and image (whether with local storage, CDN etc) 
- Configure Vuex persisted store
- Add/edit/delete meme entry functionality
- Some global styling 
- And upload it to your github.
